                    The tag-42 profile of CBOR Core
                  draft-caballero-cbor-cborc42-latest

Abstract

   This document defines a strict profile of CBOR Core (CBOR/c) intended
   for use with the special tag 42.  Like the CBOR Core it profiles,
   "CBOR/c-42" can also be used as an internet-scale serialization for
   JSON, and is optimized for objects that compose into a directed
   acyclical graph.  Since CBOR/c-42 objects link to one another by
   hash-based identifiers, deterministic encoding is mandated.  This
   document mainly targets CBOR tool developers and those downstream
   users who would like to precisely configure their tools.

1.  Introduction

   The IPFS ecosystem has long made structural usage of its own home-
   grown CBOR profile, dating from the early days of the CBOR working
   group and fine-tuned over the years in community/internal venues.
   Configuring CBOR tooling in various languages to decode this data and
   encode new data conformantly has been a challenge, and a unified
   specification (updated to modern terminology, as the CBOR working
   group has iterated and evolved so much in the intervening years) is
   set out in this document.

   Note: unlike the CBOR/c specification, no opinion on signing
   mechanics is expressed here, and will be addressed in future
   documents, if at all.

1.1.  Design Goals

   The primary goal with this specification, is enabling application
   developers to configure CBOR tooling for this profile in as language-
   agnostic a way as possible.  The historical design of this profile
   was to maximize determinism and simplicity for an internet-scale
   directed acyclical graph of CBOR documents linked to one another by
   binary hashes.  These simple content identifiers, defined in
   Appendix A, are always expressed as bytestrings of tag 42 (similar in
   design to to [RFC6920] Named Information Hashes).  All other tags,
   and many major and minor types, are forbidden to reduce ambiguity,
   and developers are encouraged to express many kinds of data at higher
   layers by using the supported types (such as strings or bytestrings).

1.2.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.3.  Common Definitions

   *  This document uses the conventions defined in CDDL [RFC8610] for
      expressing the type of CBOR [RFC8949] data items.

   *  Examples showing CBOR data, are expressed in "diagnostic notation"
      as defined in Section 8 of [RFC8949].

   *  The term "CBOR object" is equivalent to "CBOR data item" used in
      [RFC8949].

   *  The term "CBOR Core" is in this document abbreviated to "CBOR/c".

2.  Specification

   This section describes how CBOR/c-42 subsets CBOR and differs from a
   standard CDE encoding.

2.2.  Deterministic Encoding Scheme Profile

   As in CBOR/c, deterministic encoding is mandatory.  The encoding
   scheme adheres to Section 4.2 of [RFC8949], but adds a few
   constraints (denoted below by RFC+), where this RFC offers choices.
   The following list contains a summary of the deterministic encoding
   rules:

   *  RFC+: Floating-point and integer objects MUST be treated as
      distinct types regardless of their numeric value.  This is
      compliant with Rule 2 in Section 4.2.2 of [RFC8949].

   *  RFC: Integers, represented by the int and bigint types, MUST use
      the int type if the value is between -264 and 264-1, otherwise the
      bigint type MUST be used.

      -  Appendix B.1 features a list of integer sample values and their
         expected encoding.

   *  RFC+: UNLIKE CBOR/c and standard CDE encoding, floating-point
      numbers MUST always be encoded using the longest [IEEE754]
      variant.  Appendix B.2 features a list of floating-point sample
      values and their expected encoding.

   *  RFC+: NaN values with payloads (like f97e01), or having the most
      significant bit set ("signaling"), MUST be rejected.  See also
      Appendix B.4 for invalid NaN variants.

   *  RFC: Map keys MUST be sorted in the bytewise lexicographic order
      of their deterministic encoding.  Duplicate keys (i.e. keys with
      identical determinstic bytestring values) MUST be rejected; note
      that semantic equivalence is not tested.  As per the "Canonical
      CBOR" section (3.9) in [RFC7049], the following represents a
      properly sorted map: { "a": ... , "b": ... , "aa": ... }

   *  RFC+: Since CBOR encodings according to this specification
      maintain uniqueness, there are no specific restrictions or tests
      needed in order to determine map key equivalence.  As an (extreme)
      example, the floating-point numbers 0.0 and -0.0, and the integer
      number 0 could represent the distinct keys f90000, f98000, and 00
      respectively.

   *  RFC: Indefinite length objects MUST be rejected.

Appendix C.  Test Vectors: Floating Point Numbers

   *TODO - Update this entire chart!*

   The textual representation of the values is based on the
   serialization method for the Number data type, defined by
   [ECMASCRIPT] with one change: to comply with diagnostic notation
   (section 8 of [RFC8949]), all values are expressed as floating-point
   numbers.  The rationale for using [ECMASCRIPT] serialization is
   because it is supposed to generate the shortest and most correct
   representation of [IEEE754] numbers.
