# For initial setup, you only need to edit the first block of fields.
# Only "title" needs to be changed; delete "abbrev" if your title is short.
# Any other content can be edited, but be careful not to introduce errors.
# Some fields will be set automatically during setup if they are unchanged.
#
# Don't include "-00" or "-latest" in the filename.
# Labels in the form draft-<yourname>-<workgroup>-<name>-latest are used by
# the tools to refer to the current version; see "docname" for example.

--- abstract

This document defines a strict profile of CBOR Core (CBOR/c) intended for use with the special tag 42.
Like the CBOR Core it profiles, "CBOR/c-42" can also be used as an internet-scale serialization for JSON, and is optimized for objects that compose into a directed acyclical graph.
Since CBOR/c-42 objects link to one another by hash-based identifiers, deterministic encoding is mandated.
This document mainly targets CBOR tool developers and those downstream users who would like to precisely configure their tools.
